Road Accident Analysis
Presenting a robust dashboard that conducts an in-depth analysis and visualization of road accident data spanning the years 2021 and 2022.

Project Objective:
With the primary objective of comprehending and addressing road safety requirements, this dashboard provides key performance indicators and valuable insights into road accidents.

Tools used:
1.Excel 2.Tableau 3.Power Bi 4.MySQL

Steps Involved:
1.Data Collection and Preparation: Gather the necessary data for your analysis. Ensure the data is clean, accurate, and relevant to your objectives. Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing.

2.Import Data into the Chosen Tool: Load your dataset into the selected tool or platform. Ensure that the data is structured in a way that supports easy analysis and visualization.

3.Identify Key Metrics: Determine the key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics you want to highlight in your dashboard. These should align with your objectives.

4.Design Layout: Plan the layout of your dashboard. Organize the visual elements in a way that is intuitive for your audience. Consider using a grid system for consistency.

5.Create Visualizations: Utilize appropriate charts and graphs to represent your data. Common types include bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps. Ensure that the visualizations effectively convey the intended information.

KPI's:
ðŸ”¹ Total Casualties Analysis ðŸ”¹ Analysis of Casualties based on Severity and Vehicle Type ðŸ”¹ Breakdown of Casualties by Vehicle Type ðŸ”¹ Monthly Trend Analysis ðŸ”¹ Road Type Analysis ðŸ”¹ Distribution of Casualties by Road Surface ðŸ”¹ Relationship of Casualties with Area/Location & Day/Night

Key Insights:
The pivotal findings derived from this project are truly enlightening: âœ… The overall number of casualties resulting from accidents is staggering at 417,883. âœ… Car accidents emerged as the leading contributor to casualties, constituting a substantial 79.8% of the total. In contrast, accidents involving other vehicle types resulted in minimal casualties. âœ… Across the years 2021 and 2022, total casualties stood at 222,146 and 195,737, respectively. Examining the trends between these two years offers valuable insights for targeted interventions. âœ… Detailed analysis unveiled specific months characterized by the highest and lowest casualties, allowing for nuanced strategies tailored to different times of the year. âœ… By pinpointing road types and surfaces linked to the highest casualties, authorities can prioritize safety measures and focus road maintenance efforts accordingly.
